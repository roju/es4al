This study examines the effectiveness of kinesthetic learning activities compared to the traditional lecture method. The Kinesthetic Learning Activities module is an active approach where students learn through physical activities instead of sitting and listening to an instructorâ€™s lecture. In this study, participants do the pre-test first and then watch KLA dancing videos, KLA visual animation videos, traditional lecture videos and then do the post-test.
