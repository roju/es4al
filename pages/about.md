The purpose of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of different teaching methods for students learning about sorting algorithms.

In this study, participants will:

- First, provide some basic personal information.
- Second, take a pre-test to assess their knowledge about a particular sorting algorithm.
- Third, watch an educational video about the assigned algorithm which employs one of three possible learning methods: KLA dance (Kinesthetic Learning Activity), visual animation, or traditional lecture.
- Last, take the same test again to assess how much their knowledge has improved.
